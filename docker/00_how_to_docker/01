# 1. Create a virtual machine with docker-machine using the virtualbox driver, and named Char
docker-machine create --driver virtualbox Char
# 2. Get the IP address of the Char virtual machine. (192.168.99.100)
docker-machine ip Char
# 3. Define the variables needed by your virtual machine Char in the general env of your
# terminal, so that you can run the docker ps command without errors. You have
# to fix all four environment variables with one command, and you are not allowed
# to use your shell’s builtin to set these variables by hand.
eval $(docker-machine env Char)
# 3. Get the hello-world container from the Docker Hub, where it’s available.
docker pull hello-world
# 4. Launch the hello-world container, and make sure that it prints its welcome message, then leaves it.
docker run hello-world
# 6. Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
# should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
# attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
# properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.
docker pull nginx
docker run nginx &
docker container rename 01f27cfcc3ae overlord
